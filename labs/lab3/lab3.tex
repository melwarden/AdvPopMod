\section{Linear mixed effects using R}
\subsection{streams}

The models fit to the streams data were fixed effect with intercept only (lm1), 
fixed effect with no intercept (lm2) and mixed effect (lme). Summary 
information for the mixed effects model lme1 is in Table 1. The estimates 
for $\sigma$ and $\sigma_b$ were 14.34 and 6.08, respectively.

Residuals for lm1 (Fig 1) show that there is variation between streams, and so a 
stream effect is likely needed. Variability within streams and between streams
looks similar whether the stream effect is fixed or random (Fig 1), but with a
fixed effect we cannot make inference for streams that were not sampled.

A plot of residuals versus fitted values for the mixed effect model (Fig 2) 
shows no outlying observations or potentially influential data points, although 
data are limited with only 3 observations per stream.

Residual analysis for the mixed effect model (Fig 3) shows no departure from
normality (top left and top right panels), and no strong temporal pattern
(top middle). Within-group variances are similar (bottom left). The random 
effects show no departure from normality (bottom middle and right).
